14579	Summary: a. Research background of this article: This study investigates the impact of semantic degradation on lexical item selection and syntactic processing in patients with semantic dementia (SD). b. Past methods, their problems, and motivation: Prior research has confirmed that SD patients experience difficulty producing open class content words, which are substituted by higher frequency, less specific terms. However, the extent of lexical deficits in SD and their effect on closed class items, semantic and syntactic processing, remains unclear. c. Research methodology proposed in this paper: The study analyzed naturally-occurring speech errors produced by patients with SD and healthy controls, and compared their performance on tasks requiring lexical access and syntactic processing. d. Task and performance achieved by the methods in this paper: The study found that SD patients produced a higher rate of errors to both open and closed class items, with substitutions and omissions more prevalent for open class words, and substitution errors more prevalent for closed class words, however, these errors did not significantly alter the syntactic structure of sentences produced by SD patients. Background: a. Subject and characteristics: The subject of this article is semantic dementia (SD), a progressive neurological condition that causes significant deterioration of semantic knowledge across modalities. b. Historical development: Prior research has shown that SD patients experience difficulty producing open class content words. c. Past methods: Previous studies have analyzed speech errors in patients with SD and controls. d. Past research shortcomings: Past research failed to examine the extent of lexical deficits in SD and their effect on closed class items, semantic and syntactic processing. e. Current issues to address: The authors aim to address how the degradation of semantic knowledge affects speech production in SD patients, specifically the influence on structure or content of speech. Methods: a. Theoretical basis of the study: This study is underpinned by the framework that emphasizes the role of semantic knowledge in the pre-verbal message representation, lexical retrieval, and early stages of grammatical encoding in language production. b. Technical route of the article (step by step): The authors recruited patients with semantic dementia and healthy controls. Participants were asked to complete tasks requiring lexical access and syntactic processing. The study analyzed naturally-occurring speech errors produced by patients and controls and compared their performance. Conclusion: a. Significance of the work: The study highlights the impact of semantic degradation on speech production in SD patients and demonstrates that while they experience difficulty with both open and closed class items, certain types of errors may be accounted for by the semantic deficit. b. Innovation, performance, and workload: The study adds to previous research by examining errors related to open and closed class items, and highlights the preserved structure of syntax in SD speech to some extent. c. Research conclusions (list points): The study found that SD patients produce a higher rate of errors to both open and closed class items. Errors for open class words were more prevalent for substitutions and omissions, whereas errors for closed class words were more prevalent for substitution errors. These errors did not significantly alter the syntactic structure of sentences produced by SD patients. Phonological processes were preserved in SD patients, with only one patient demonstrating phonological errors.

397819	Summary: a. Research background of this article: The article examines whether teaching biological theories of sexual orientation in college human sexuality courses reduces sexual prejudice towards the LGBT community. b. Past methods, their problems, and motivation: Past studies have shown inconsistent results in using biological evidence to reduce sexual prejudice, and while intergroup contact and sustained discussions can lead to decreased essentialist beliefs and prejudice, relying solely on essentialist or anti-essentialist theories is not effective. c. Research methodology proposed in this paper: A 10-week seminar on LGBT psychology was taught to 36 psychology students, where biological theories were not presented or discussed. Cross-lagged design was used to observe the students’ essentialist thinking and sexual prejudice before and after the seminar. d. Task and performance achieved by the methods in this paper: The results showed that sexual prejudice and two forms of essentialist thinking were reduced significantly, implying that biological theories are not essential in prejudice reduction. Background: a. Subject and characteristics: The article examines the effects of teaching essentialist or anti-essentialist theories of sexuality to college students in human sexuality classes. b. Historical development: Past studies have shown the relationship between essentialist thinking and prejudice towards sexual minorities and the inconsistent effects of presenting biological evidence on attitudes towards homosexuality. c. Past methods: Past studies have used intergroup contact, sustained discussions, and the presentation of biological evidence to reduce sexual prejudice and essentialist beliefs. d. Past research shortcomings: Past methods have shown inconsistent results in reducing sexual prejudice and essentialist beliefs. e. Current issues to address: The article explores effective methods for reducing sexual prejudice and essentialist beliefs in college students taking human sexuality classes. Methods: a. Theoretical basis of the study: The study is based on attribution theory, which predicts that the attribution of stigma to personal control leads to anger, and the attribution to factors beyond personal control leads to positive emotions. b. Technical route of the article (step by step): The author conducted a 10-week seminar on LGBT psychology for 36 psychology students in the South of England. Cross-lagged design was used to observe the students’ essentialist thinking and sexual prejudice before and after the seminar. The seminar did not present or discuss biological theories of sexual orientation. Classroom and homework exercises, such as writing coming out letters, role-playing, shadowing lesbian/gay people, and learning to challenge expressed prejudice created empathy for LGBT individuals. Conclusion: a. Significance of the work: The study provides evidence that presenting biological theories of sexual orientation is not essential in reducing sexual prejudice and essentialist beliefs in college students taking human sexuality classes. b. Innovation, performance, and workload: The study showed a significant reduction in sexual prejudice and essentialist beliefs after a 10-week seminar on LGBT psychology. The workload involved classroom and homework exercises. c. Research conclusions (list points): Sexual prejudice and two forms of essentialist thinking were found to significantly reduce after a 10-week seminar on LGBT psychology that did not present or discuss biological theories of sexual orientation. Classroom and homework exercises, such as writing coming out letters, role-playing, shadowing lesbian/gay people, and learning to challenge expressed prejudice, can create empathy towards LGBT individuals. The article concludes that reducing reliance on androcentric textbooks in the psychology of sexual minorities would counter androcentrism and recognize the experiences of students who identify as bisexual, queer, and 'mostly straight.'
1352001	Summary: a. Research background of this article: The paper discusses the phenomenon of loop oscillations in the corona and explores a possible mechanism for the excitation of kink-mode oscillations using a vortex shedding model. b. Past methods, their problems, and motivation: The article examines the phenomenon of vortex shedding in coronal loops when interacting with an upflow and explains the mechanism responsible for exciting loop oscillations. c. Research methodology proposed in this paper: The paper proposes a model that suggests upflows from coronal mass ejections (CMEs) generate a quasi-periodic horizontal force on alternating sides of the loop, excites oscillations most effectively when in resonance with the natural frequency of the kink oscillations, and explains the selectivity of the excitation and the preferred excitation of the global mode. d. Task and performance achieved by the methods in this paper: The study provides insight into the excitation mechanism of kink-mode oscillations and explains the observed selectivity of the excitation and the preferred excitation of the global mode. Background: a. Subject and characteristics: The article discusses loop oscillations in the solar corona and their association with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and destabilized filaments. b. Historical development: Loop oscillations have been commonly observed after flare-like processes, and existing theoretical models have connected the transverse oscillations observed with the TRACE to CMEs. c. Past methods: Prior to this study, models explaining the excitation mechanism of kink-mode oscillations in coronal loops were limited. d. Past research shortcomings: Prior models did not effectively explain the selectivity of the excitation and the preferred excitation of the global mode. e. Current issues to address: The study aims to address the excitation mechanism of kink-mode oscillations in coronal loops, specifically the selectivity of the excitation and the preferred excitation of the global mode. Methods: a. Theoretical basis of the study: The study uses hydrodynamic principles to explain the mechanism responsible for exciting loop oscillations and proposes a model that suggests upflows from coronal mass ejections (CMEs) generate a quasi-periodic horizontal force. b. Technical route of the article (step by step): The model suggests that the magnetic field in dragged plasma is parallel to the loop, creating a quasi-periodic horizontal force that is applied to alternating sides of the loop. The oscillations are excited most effectively when the force is in resonance with the natural frequency of the kink oscillations. The dynamics of the apex of the coronal loop can be modeled using an equation for the oscillation caused by the restoring magnetohydrodynamic force and the vortex shedding force connected with the coronal mass ejection upflow. The efficiency of the excitation of oscillations by the external force depends on the time dependence of the force. c. Research conclusions (list points): The proposed model provides insight into the excitation mechanism of kink-mode oscillations and explains the observed selectivity of the excitation and the preferred excitation of the global mode. The oscillations are excited most efficiently when the force is in resonance with the natural frequency of the kink oscillations. The decay of vertically polarized kink oscillations of coronal loops is attributed to aerodynamic drag with zero viscosity and resistivity, which provides momentum coupling between the oscillating loop and the ambient coronal plasma. This mechanism explains the excitation of propagating transverse waves in supra-arcades and of flare-associated winking prominences and filaments. Conclusion: a. Significance of the work: The study's proposed model sheds light on the excitation mechanism of kink-mode oscillations and explains the observed selectivity of the excitation and the preferred excitation of the global mode. b. Innovation, performance, and workload: The study's proposed model provides an innovative explanation for the excitation mechanism of kink-mode oscillations and its observed selectivity, which can improve our understanding of the solar coronal dynamics. c. Research conclusions (list points): The proposed model suggests upflows from coronal mass ejections (CMEs) generate a quasi-periodic horizontal force that is responsible for exciting kink-mode oscillations. The oscillations are excited most effectively when the force is in resonance with the natural frequency of the kink oscillations. The model explains the decay of vertically polarized kink oscillations of coronal loops and the excitation of propagating transverse waves in supra-arcades and of flare-associated winking prominences and filaments.
